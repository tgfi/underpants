# Welcome to Underpants

Underpants is a Rails 3.2 application that we use at [TGFI](http://www.tgfi.net/) as a starting point for some of our projects.

The core pieces include:

- Devise Authentication
- Subdomain based Accounts
- Inherited Resources
- Twitter Bootstrap using the asset pipeline
- HAML
- Coffee Script
- MySQL

Check out the Gemfile for more info.

## How do I make this work?

1. Fork it. Clone it, then blow away your .git folder. Whatever is fastest.
2. Do a case sensitive search and replace for <tt>Underpants</tt> => <tt>YourAppName</tt>.
3. Do a case sensitive search and replace for <tt>underpants</tt> => <tt>your_app_name</tt>.
4. Configure your database.yml file.
5. Use Ruby 1.9.3. That could be rvm, rbenv or something else.
6. Start coding.

## Why doesn't it have X?

First off, this is a barebones app to save us some setup time. We thought it might do the same for you. Second, because code is a personal choice. If you don't like it, change it. We expect to change things once we get going.

## Issues
If you have problems, please create a Github Issue. Just know that we're not going to help you install it.
